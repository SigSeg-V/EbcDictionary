# EbcDictionary
*For when your hex dumps are way too large.*

## What's the point?
If you have seen a PEM dump you'll know that there is a large amount of ebcdic hex output, and it is difficult to read more than a small part at a time. Usually a PEM dump has readable text in it so it is worth translating it to debug. This is where Ebcdictionary comes in! just paste the hex in and plain text will be output.
